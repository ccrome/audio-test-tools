This is a simple portaudio based ramp tester that tests linux SoC
sound Tx and Rx capability for bit perfection.

For this to work, your system must be set up like this:

   * Tx and Rx are on the same bus, at the same speed, with the same
     number of channels in each direction
   * You must loop back the TDM port's DOUT to DIN

check the help message for all options
# ./ramp_pa --help

The following test will run the ramp tester for 1000 seconds, on 16
channels, at 16Hz.

# ./ramp_pa -c 16 -f 16000 -l .1 -t 1000
